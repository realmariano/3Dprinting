# carrier photomask

Since in Argentina is not easy to get photomask carriers because of several regulations and imposibility (or really hard process to do goverment payments to foreign countries, not worth it for such cheap things) I decided to make my own printed design.
For this I use the file given by http://domoticx.com/3d-ontwerp-scad-hinged-box-with-latch/

The design is made in souch way that one can change the mask width and everything changes acordingly.
